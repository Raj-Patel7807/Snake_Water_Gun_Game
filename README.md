# Snack, Water, Gun Game 🥨💧🔫

A simple console-based **Snack, Water, Gun** game (similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors) written in C++. In this game, the player chooses one of three options: **Snack (0), Water (1), or Gun (2)**. The computer also randomly picks one of the three options, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## How It Works 💡
1. The player enters a number (0 for Snack, 1 for Water, or 2 for Gun).
2. The computer generates a random number between 0 and 2.
3. The game rules are:
   - Snack (0) beats Water (1)
   - Water (1) beats Gun (2)
   - Gun (2) beats Snack (0)
   - If both choose the same option, it’s a draw.

## Example Run 🕹️
```plaintext
Enter 0 for snack, 1 for water and 2 for gun : 1 You choose 1 Computer choose 2 You Lose!!
```

## How to Compile and Run ▶️
1. Save the code to a file, e.g., `snack_water_gun.cpp`.
2. Compile using:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o snack_water_gun snack_water_gun.cpp
   ```
3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./snack_water_gun
    ```
